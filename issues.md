bullet time doesn't slow additional enemy spawn rate or spawn velocity
wipeout weirdly only removes some enemies
spawn timers arent random enough
no startup screen
no score modifiers
powerups need timer countdown visual
score powerup needs floating notifier to say score +2
font awesome icons
collision for non-circles
collision for rotating objects
vertical velocities
screen too tall
enemies spawn at safe zone height
safe zone styling
game over needs to explode everything
random particle colors
high score board
destroying an enemy when invincible needs score +1 notification
